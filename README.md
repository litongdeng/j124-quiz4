<h1> JOURN 124 - Week 4 Quiz</h1>
I picked the question shown in the chart because I really appreciate having reclining seats on airplanes, and would never want to give them up. The majority of respondents seem to agree with me, which is good! My chart shows that more than twice the amount of respondents said "no" to the question than "yes." Thus, it can be theorized that most people also prefer to have reclining seats on planes.
