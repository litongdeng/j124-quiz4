<h1> JOURN 124 - Week 4 Quiz</h1>
I picked the question shown in the chart because I really appreciate having reclining seats on airplanes, and would never want to give them up. The majority of respondents in this dataset seem to agree with me, which is interesting! My chart shows that more than twice the amount of respondents said "no" to the question than "yes." Thus, it can be theorized that most people also prefer to have reclining seats on planes. 

![Bar chart showing answers to the question, "Given the opportunity, would you eliminate the possibility of reclining seats on planes entirely?" The bar for "no" is more than twice the length of the bar for "yes."](NGdsx-given-the-opportunity-would-you-eliminate-the-possibility-of-reclining-seats-on-planes-entirely-.png)
